### Where Data is Stored

All data is stored locally using:

- We do not transfer user data to third parties
- We do not use data for advertising

## Data Security

Your data is protected by your browser's built-in security mechanisms. Since no data is transmitted over the internet, there is no risk of data interception during transmission.

## Your Control Over Your Data
